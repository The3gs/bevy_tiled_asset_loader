# bevy_tiled_asset_loader

I found the available tooling for using Tiled maps seriously lacking so I made my own bevy asset loader.

Currently this is not terribly well refined, and I am planning on making improvements as I use it for my personal project.

Once I feel this is ready for general use, I plan on publishing it to crates.io, but I would like it to be a bit more finished first.
